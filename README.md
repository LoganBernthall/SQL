LoganBernthall / SQL repository:

This repository is to showcase learning and simple SQL projects I have created to assist in my understanding of SQL. 

* Learning - Files of basic SQL functions

* Keywords- A txt file containing simple keyword explanations.
  
* Projects:
  
*   Library database - simple database showing the relationship between tables in a very simple manner. Would not recommend using this method in a real setting as this is purely for the purpose of showing relationship database logic.

*  Record shop - An extension of logic from library database, featuring more tables, more relationships in an expanded manner. Would not recommend using this method in a real setting as this is purely for the purpose of showing relationship database logic.
